# Orsted
[Orsted](https://orsted.com/) is a big danish player in the energy market.
The HQ is located in Copenhagen, Denmark.

I applied for a position as a Data Scientist in the Energy Trading team.
This profile was intended to work side by side with a Data Analyst and a Trader.

The technical interview consisted in a single session of 1 hour where I've analyzed a dataset they provided me (_data.pkl_).
We focused on the following topics:
    - Time series of gas price in UK
    - Global properties
    - Detrending w.r.t. foundamentals (residual load)
    - Justify outlier behaviour (start of the war in 2022, stock run during summer 2022, temperature drop during Christmas 2022)


The interview went well and in fact I was offered the position.
The offer was of 68k DKK (9.1k EUR) per month (about 5.5k EUR after tax).

At the end I've decided to decline because I wanted to finish the interview for a company that was more interesting from my point of view (InCommodities).
