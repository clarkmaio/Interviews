# Starship Technologies
Starship is [this](https://www.starship.xyz/).
It is a super interesting company dealing with self driving robot for food (or stuff) delivery.

I just did a little dashboard to show my salary expectations because of a bet with HR.

I failed the interview at the second step.



## How to run it
The code is self contained.

To run it locally:
1. Install `steamlit` python package via `pip install streamlit`
2. Run the following line from terminal:

```
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
