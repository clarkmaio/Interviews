# ENI
This is the technical assessment I did after 2 online interviews for the position of **Data scientist** in the **Center of excellence Data Science Group**.

I passed all the steps but at the end I've rejected the job because the salary was not high enough (~50k Euro).
<br>
Except for the salary the position was really interesting, I think they do really cool stuff in that team.


## Run the code
You can run the code simply running the command:
```
python run_main.py
```

Note that the script will create folders to store plots and results.


## Documents
You can find a presentation to show the approach I've adopted and the results  `ENI_DataChallange_presentation.pdf`.
<br>
You will also find a document in which I explain step by step what I did and why `ENI_DataChallange.pdf` (**This last document is in Italian because I am a moron**).
