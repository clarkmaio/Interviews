# Bolt
This is the assessment I did for the Data Scientist position in Bolt.
The assessment it self is very interisting and present a lot of different complexity layers.

It would be a very interesting problem voth for graph theory, game theory and reinforcement learning.
Unluckily I don't know enough of these fields to solve the problem as I would.

**I am not at all happy about the result and I am going to study a lot and try to solve it again.**

Meanwhile you can have a look to my solution written as Jupyter Notebook (I hate Jupyter Notebooks).
