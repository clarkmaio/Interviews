# Bolt
This is the assessment I did for the Data Scientist position in Bolt.
The assessment it self is very interisting and present a lot of different complexity layers.

It would be a very interesting problem voth for graph theory, game theory and reinforcement learning.
Unluckily I don't know enough of these fields to solve the problem as I would.

Meanwhile you can have a look to my solution written as Jupyter Notebook (I hate Jupyter Notebooks).

I didn't pass the second step. I think I did the worst interview in my life giving no sense answers.

For example I said "dictionary in Python are sorted object".
<br>I don't know why I behaved like that, I guess I was not at the right level, and that's the reason of my insecurity.


I have just ***A LOT*** to study... lets do it :)
